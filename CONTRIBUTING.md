# Contribute to muzikilo.js
You want to start hacking muzikilo.js? A good way to do so is to look at the [issue tracker](https://github.com/anuejn/muzikilo.js/issues) and report bugs, draft new features or write code.
However, here are some guidelines:

## Open an issue before you start to write code.
This helps to reduce disappointment if someone is already working on the same topic or if we have other plans.

## Create pull request early and mark them as WIP.
This helps to reduce code.

## Format your code right.
We use [prettier](https://prettier.io/) to format our code. Just run `yarn format` before you commit your files.

## Be open to changes.
Maybe someone else has different opinions about the implementation of a specific feature than you. We are open to discuss different solutions with you.
